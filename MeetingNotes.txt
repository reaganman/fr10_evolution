from meeting with Vicente
- Vicente prepared letters for 9 institutions. We are now figuring out how to reach out to the collections managers at these institutions:
-- Bishop Museum (collections manager: Molly Hagemann - we sent her an email)
---- May have online portal
-- Field Museum (collections managers Chun and Josh - we sent them an email)
---- Requires formal request on letterhead sent by mail
-- Natural History Museum at Los Angeles (collections manager Neftali Camacho - we sent him an email)
---- Requires formal request on letterhead sent by email
---- https://nhm.org/research-collections/departments/herpetology
-- Sternberg Museum at Fort Hayes State University (curators Laura Wilson and William Stark - we sent them an email)
-- Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (staff curator: Carol Spencer. Curators: Rebecca Tarvin and Jim McGuire- Randy will email them)
-- Sam Noble OMNH (curator: Cameron Siler- go ahead and send formal letter when ready to his email)
---- https://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Herpetology-loan-Policy.pdf
-- California Academy of Sciences (collections manager: Lauren Scheinberg - Randy emailed her)
---- Requires formal request on letterhead sent by email
---- https://www.calacademy.org/scientists/herpetology-collection
-- Royal Ontario Museum (museum director- Josh Basseches, curator- Bob Murphy - Randy emailed Bob)
-- Florida Museum (collections manager- Coleman Sheehy - Randy emailed him)
-- Additionally, consider the requirements specific to each institution
-- For instance, the Field Museum has a page about tissue loans with a procedure for loans: https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/amphibians-reptiles/amphibians-reptiles-policies-loans-and-collection-visits

- The letters should be updated based on Randy's general edits to the Fort Hayes State (Aspidoscelis) letter.
-- Some general things that letters should contain:
---- Specify that we are a PUI (primarily undergraduate institution with no graduate program.
---- Only request a maximum of five samples per species
---- Our requested tissue size: 20-25 mg (toe clip or liver is ideal)
---- If DNA extraction is available, that would be preferred over the tissue sample. Otherwise we would use the available tissue sample to extract DNA here at Utah Tech (we recently purchased a DNA extraction kit dedicated to this project).
---- State that we are procuring tissues from multiple institutions to complete this project, and that it will be a great example of the utility of natural history collections with addressing large-scale evolutionary questions.
---- Qualifications: Vicente- Natural Science major, coursework in genetics, field research seminar, individual research, and international research fellow. Randy- Professor of biology with focus on evolutionary genetics, has worked in/with museums for multiple projects (accesioning specimens, extracting and sequencing DNA from tissue loans) to contribute to projects on phylogenetics and evolution (cite Randy's papers from Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution (Draco) and American Naturalist (Aspidoscelis)).
---- If the museum is interested in storing the remaining DNA extraction, we can provide this back to the institution.

-- Also, create an additional letter for LSUMZ (for Rana temporaria)

4 October 2023
from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Reagan created an alignment file called exons_blastn.fasta, which contains the aligned results from a blastn he did where he independently looked for the three different exons accross all of the frog genomes on Genbank.
- We then used AliView to develop primers, and Randy will finish this up and select three primer sets to get the three exons for Ranid species
- Reagan will look at where the different Ranid species with genomic data live and categorize them as "cold" and "not cold", then look at the nucleotide frequency between these.

from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Get exon 1 for other taxa that are lacking it in the tblast_alignments.fasta file (see blastn results), add these to the tblast_alignments.fasta file and save this as a new file called "consensus_alignment.fasta" 
- Get exon 1 and 3 for Nanorana (and any others that have them missing) by looking at the genome itself (use the exon 2 location, and crop genome on several thousand bp on either end to include exon 1 and 3. You can then search for these using blast.
- Merge sequences for individual taxa so there is a single sequence for each taxon
- Keep working on finding primers; specifically, look for 3 sets of primers: (1) primers for exon 1, (2) primers for exon 2, (3) primers for exon 3
- Reagan was trying tblast with the whole genetic region (the 3 exons and their two large introns)
--- This is based on a hunch that their may be alternative splicing
--- Let's not focus on alternative splicing for now, but keep this in mind and look at it later


18 September 2023
from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Look for first 15 aa in sylvaticus genome: where are they located? Reagan will work on this
- Try to find primers. Try blast-short, but also look at highly-conserved sequences at the beginning and end of the loci that hit.
- Vicente will fill in latitude/elevation data

15 September 2023
From meeting with Randy and Vicente
- Take time to do plural sight tutorial on using pandas (python package)
- Work on adding elevation/latitude data to the Ranidae_latitude_and_elevation spreadsheet
-- Use ranid_data_curation.py script as a starting point to mess with pandas (you can modify this however you want)

8 September 2023
From meeting with Vicente:
- Get new database from vertnet that includes all Ranidae specimens (not just tissues)
--  This will provide more info on lat/long and elevation
- Use pandas to find lat/long and elevation info from the new vertnet database

28 August 2023
1. Vicente- add Lithobates species to maps, and additional Rana species
2. Reagan- get amino acid sequences from the four species
-- We need to go into the genome to do this- there may be an intron...
3. Reagan and Vicente- figure out pandas (tutorial: https://github.com/joaks1/python-tabular-data)
-- Goal with pandas: pull out all of the taxa of interest and put them into a csv
4. For next time (or if Randy has time), design primers

19 June 2023
1. Update CatPop github documentation to include exact coding steps
   (example code: https://github.com/KLab-UT/CHPC-intro/blob/main/README.md)
2. Download reference frog genomes to scratch DONE!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/reference_genomes
3. Create blast database for reference genomes in scratch CURRENTLY RUNNING!
   scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_db
4. Generate blast output in scratch READY TO GO!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_outputs

-----------------------


1. Create summary of blast results to all genomes. Within summary, include this:
a. If a genome got a hit
b. How many hits each genome got
c. what is the gene that got hit and what is its e-value for the hit
   --- Many of the genes may not have gene names, but you can check by taking the sequence of the subject (the match on the reference) and blasting it to find out what it is. To get the sequence of the reference seq, change the -outfmt to -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid evalue qstart qend sstart send sseq".
